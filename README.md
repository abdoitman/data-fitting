# data-fitting
Created a program that fit the input vectors either to a model that the user chooses, or the best model that fit the data. The possible models are: a straight line, an exponential model, a growth rate model or a power model then returning the equation of the line and important statistics like standard deviation, correlation coefficient and the squared error.

The .m file contains the sorce MATLAB code for each model of the 4 and their equation.
While .mlapp is the code for designing the MATLAB app with the GUI.
The .mlaappinstall makes your install the program as an app inside MATLAB that you can use at any time.
