# data-fitting
Created a program that fit the input vectors either to a model that the user chooses, or the best model that fit the data. The possible models are: a straight line, an exponential model, a growth rate model or a power model then returning the equation of the line and important statistics like standard deviation, correlation coefficient and the squared error.
